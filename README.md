express-logger
===============

Express middleware for auto-archiving log files.

This middleware builds on the built-in Express logger.  It will automatically rotate your logs and archive the old logs daily.

Usage
------------

Works just like express.logger, except that you give it a path instead of a stream.

	var logger = require('express-logger');
	server.use(logger({path: "/path/to/logfile.txt"}));

Installation
------------

    $ npm install express-logger
